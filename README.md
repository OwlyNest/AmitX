# AmitX

> A hobby OS forged in sleepless nights, wild dreams, and a stubborn refusal to be ordinary.  
> Owly is just one of its many feathers — a quirky language with a hoot.

Welcome to **AmitX**, the operating system you didn’t know you needed but secretly do. This is not just a compiler toolkit or a language playground — it’s a whole ecosystem born from late-night coding frenzies and a touch of math madness.

**What makes AmitX special?**

- A kernel that lives somewhere between your 3 AM epiphanies and the complex plane.  
- A shell that *hoots* instead of echoing — because why be boring?  
- Owly, its own whimsical programming language that compiles down to C, for the brave and caffeinated.  
- Tools and scripts to make building and running your code less painful and more entertaining.

## AmitX 0.0.1 Highlights

- The Owly compiler integrated as the official language front-runner, because Owly’s sass fits perfectly.  
- Shell with personality: hoots, clears, and sometimes just stares into the void.  
- Bash scripts that compile Owly code, compile generated C, and even pop open VS Code when you want to show off.
